- **Helpful tooltips**: Hover over any button to see what it does

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader 0.16.14+
- Fabric API 0.92.6+1.20.1
- Java 17 or higher

### Steps
1. **Download**: Get the latest release from the [**üì• Releases Page**](../../releases)
2. **Install**: Place the `.jar` file in your Minecraft `mods` folder
3. **Launch**: Start Minecraft with the Fabric profile
4. **Enjoy**: Open your inventory (E key) to see the 6 square buttons arranged horizontally in the top-left corner!

> üí° **Tip**: Look for the latest release with the green "Latest" tag for the most stable version.

## Usage

- Heal: `/effect give @s minecraft:instant_health 1 10` + `/effect give @s minecraft:saturation 1 10`

- Midnight: `/time add` (calculated to reach next midnight)
- Afternoon: `/time add` (calculated to reach next afternoon)

## Development

### Building from Source

```

### Technical Details

The mod uses two different approaches for maximum compatibility:

**Survival Mode:**
- Screen Events API for button rendering
- Invisible ButtonWidget objects for click handling

**Creative Mode:**
- Mixin injection into CreativeInventoryScreen for rendering
- Custom mouse click detection for interaction

This dual approach ensures the mod works reliably across different game modes without conflicts.

## Configuration

Currently, the mod does not include configuration options. The buttons are positioned at a fixed location (top-left corner) and cannot be moved or disabled.

## Compatibility

### Supported Versions
- Minecraft: 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader: 0.16.14+
- Fabric API: 0.92.6+1.20.1

### Known Compatible Mods
- Most inventory enhancement mods
- JEI (Just Enough Items)
- REI (Roughly Enough Items)

### Potential Conflicts
- Mods that heavily modify the inventory screen layout may cause visual overlap
- Other mods that add buttons to the inventory screen might conflict for space

## Troubleshooting

### Buttons Not Visible
1. Ensure you have the correct Minecraft version (1.20.1)
2. Verify Fabric API is installed
3. Check that you have operator permissions if on a server

### Buttons Not Working
1. Verify you have permission to use the commands
2. Check server settings if playing multiplayer
3. Look at the game logs for any error messages

### Performance Issues
The mod has minimal performance impact. If you experience issues:
1. Check for conflicts with other mods
2. Ensure you have sufficient memory allocated to Minecraft
